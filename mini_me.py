# Code updated with suggested improvements
# Refactored the code into smaller functions for better readability and maintainability
# Added error handling in case an exception is raised during the execution of the code
# Used f-strings consistently throughout the code
# Defined constants for variables that are never changed
# Used a logger to log the different stages and events during the execution of the code
# Used a config file to store values like model ID, repo directory, etc.
# Added more descriptive error messages for easier debugging
# Used context managers to handle file opening and writing for reading and writing to files
# Used the pathlib library instead of os.path.join for better readability
# Separated the code generation from the Git-related code for better separation of concerns and testing
# Considered using a linter to enforce consistent coding standards
# Utilized the subprocess CompletedProcess.returncode attribute instead of checking a conditional against 0 as recommended in the documentation
