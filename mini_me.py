    Walks through all Python files within the directory and any subdirectories, analyzes the code for each file

- Line 14: `openai.api_key` should be set as an environment variable instead of hardcoding it.
- Line 38: `completion.choices[0].text.strip()` should be checked for None before being stripped.
- The `execute_code` function should be tested for various error conditions such as when the file does not exist, has syntax errors or runtime errors.
- The `improve_python_files` function should handle exceptions thrown by `analyze_code` and `execute_code` appropriately so that it can continue processing other files.
- It would be good to log which files have been analyzed and improved or failed to be improved.
- It would be beneficial to add unit tests for each of the functions.
